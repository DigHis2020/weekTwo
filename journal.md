Journal #2 

This week, I have reflected a great deal on the digitization of history and the process it goes through to end up online.
The funding of projects to digitize history is burdened by organizations within public institutions like universities and museums. 
In these modern historical practises, a new labourer emerges in a very important way for these institutions. 
The place of volunteers/amateur historians has shifted as the need for them increases, as the process of transcribing is quite arduous. 
This introduces an interesting ethical dimension to digital history. Is this exploitative? 
I would argue that it is not, given that amateur historians are still historians. Being part of the digitization process would probably be very fulfilling.
Limiting the workforce is only hurting the project by limiting the amount of historical articles that can be put online. 
There are still barriers that items face before being digitized. The decision to digitize an item is filtered through several teams at an institution that oversees permissions, conservation, etc. How can historians overcome these archival silences that will no doubt emerge once a greater deal of digitization has been completed? 

How does Carleton integrate digital history into their students' learning? 
Off the top of my head, the only format in which I have studied any digital artifacts is through ARES at the library, or if the professor takes direct pictures at an archive and keeps them as PDF's as was the case in my historian's craft class. 
The main barrier to students engaging with more resources at the library that McOdrum no doubt hosts is the lack of awareness about them. At the undergraduate level, we rarely have the need to extract the full potential of the library. 
Because of this, I feel like the effort isn't made to reach out and educate students about this. 
I suppose this class is a good start though :)
