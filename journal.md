Journal #2 

This week, I have reflected a great deal on the digitization of history and the process it goes through to end up online.
The funding of projects to digitize history is burdened by organizations within public institutions like universities and museums. 
In these modern historical practises, a new labourer emerges in a very important way for these institutions. 
The place of volunteers/amateur historians has shifted as the need for them increases, as the process of transcribing is quite arduous. 
This introduces an interesting ethical dimension to digital history. Is this exploitative?
